Day One &lt;- Instagram

Wow... a lot has changed in four years!
I'm rewriting this entire script.

To get your data exported from Instagram:
1. Go to your instagram page
2. Click on the gear next to your username
3. Select Privacy and Security
4. Go down to Data Download, and click Request Download
5. Enter your login info
6. Wait
7. Check your email for one from instagram when the download's ready
8. Click on the link in the email
9. Save the zip file to your hard drive
10. Unzip the zip file
11. On your Mac, put the unzipped directory in a directory called /Users/your_username/doig
12. Rename that unzipped directory "instagram" (lowercase)
