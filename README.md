Day One &lt;- Instagram

<p>Use Flickstagram to connect Instagram to Flickr.
<br>http://flickstagram.org/
<br>This will make a Flickr album called "Instagram Photos."

<p>Walk away and get a cup of coffee. This will take a while.

<p>Once all your Instagram photos are in Flickr,
<br>(You can see because you'll see your most recent Instagram photo)
<br>Tag all your photos with "<i>username</i>flickstagram"
<br>- At the top, click on You -> Organize
<br>- At the bottom where it says "All your content," select the album called "Instagram Photos"
<br>- Highlight all of them and drag them into the middle. (Hint: use the "Select All" link.)
<br>- Click on "Add Tags" and add the tag (so I used "kitykityflickstagram").

<p>Go get another cup of coffee while the tags are indexed within Flickr. You are now the great cornholio.

<p>Make an RSS feed of that new album.
<br>http://www.degraeve.com/flickr-rss/
<br>- In the tags field, type the tag you created above (mine was "kitykityflickstagram").
<br>- In the sort order choose "date-posted-desc"
<br>- In the maximum number of items, choose 999 (or whatever will be more than the number of photos in that Flickr album).
<br>- Click the Flickr-RSS-ify button.
